Cookie Consent includes a lightweight JavaScript plugin for alerting users about the use of cookies on your website.

It is designed to help you comply with the EU Cookie Law which requires that websites ask visitors for consent to use
most web cookies. If you install Cookie Consent you will inform your users that your website is using cookies. This
happens in the form of an "informed opt in" where you continue to use cookies but tell users that they are being used.

This approach seems to satisfy the regulators for the time being.
